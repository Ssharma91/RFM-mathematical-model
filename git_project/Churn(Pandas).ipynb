    "**Logistic regression:**\n",
    "*Weight of Evidence and information values calculated for all variables. Variables with iv score < .2 excluded.\n",
    "*Multicollinearity : Variables with VIF > 5 excluded\n",
    "*Logistic regression can predict probabilities restricted between 0 and 1 of a customer getting churned and the coefficients of the model also provide a hint of the relative importance of each input variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest**\n",
    "*It consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction\n",
    "*They ensure that the behavior of each individual tree is not too correlated\n",
    "*Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) : Random forest takes advantage of this by allowing each individual tree to randomly sample from the dataset with replacement, resulting in different trees. \n",
    "*Feature Randomness — In a normal decision tree, when it is time to split a node, we consider every possible feature and pick the one that produces the most separation between the observations in the left node vs. those in the right node. In contrast, each tree in a random forest can pick only from a random subset of features. \n",
    "*Feature importance can be extracted and the relevant features can be fed one by one to measure the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient boosted Trees:**\n",
    "*Machine learning boosting is a method for creating an ensemble. It starts by fitting an initial model (e.g. a tree or linear regression) to the data. Then a second model is built that focuses on accurately predicting the cases where the first model performs poorly. The combination of these two models is expected to be better than either model alone. Then you repeat this process of boosting many times.  Each successive model attempts to correct for the shortcomings of the combined boosted ensemble of all previous models.\n",
    "*Feature importance can be extracted and the relevant features can be fed one by one to measure the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Light GBM :**\n",
    "*Light GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm.\n",
    "*Light GBM is prefixed as ‘Light’ because of its high speed. Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run. Another reason of why Light GBM is popular is because it focuses on accuracy of results.\n",
